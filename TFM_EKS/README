-- Provision AWS Elastic Kubernetes engine  with Terraform

1. On my EC2 Linux machine, Download terraform from Hashicorp 
 > git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws

2. Go to terraform-provider-aws/examples/eks-getting-started directory

3. Run terraform init
 > terraform init

4. Run terraform plan, this will show us how many services needs to be provisioned. 
 > terraform plan
 
5. If we are good with the number of services needs to be provisioned, then we can apply
 > terraform apply 
 
6. Terraform apply takes time depends on the number of services we are going to provision.

7. Once it provisioned all services, we can check state list to see what and all it provisioned.
 > terraform state list
